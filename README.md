###personal thoughs

_My second attempt for an analogue algorithm was more accurate on the description. Even it was explained very well, most of the people draw something that i never though about it. I didn't wont to create a text that scares the reader or make him think too much for concluding an action. For that reason I found interesting the different visual tension giving from a circle and a line to create some sort of grid. While looking on different drawings, we can recognize that every person gives a different touch and express them self in different way by just using a circle and a line. The problems for creating my expectation for this work, was more on getting the people covering the whole paper with circle and lines, and not just 3 or 4 circles. But I like the results, even I expected to create more some sort of texture maze all over the paper._
